# byte-by-byte

This repository is dedicated to my daily studies, with practical exercises and snippets organized for continuous learning.

## About

Here you'll find a collection of exercises I am solving to improve my skills in SQL and other programming languages. Currently, the focus is on SQL with PostgreSQL examples, but C# and more languages will be added soon.

## Structure

- Each exercise is separated into language-specific folders.
- SQL exercises are stored in `.sql` files with explanatory comments and clear code examples.
- C# exercises will be added in their own folder with a clear structure.

## How to use

- Explore the `.sql` files to study SQL concepts, query structures, and different types of JOINs.
- Since the database schema is **not included**, these examples are meant for reading and understanding SQL syntax and logic.
- If you want to practice, you can recreate the necessary tables and data based on the queries or use online SQL playgrounds.
- Comments inside the files explain the reasoning behind each exercise for better comprehension.
